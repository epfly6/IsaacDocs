# File "fortunes.txt"

This file is used to store all "fortunes" displayed when using the "Fortune Machine" or similar.

Fortunes-entries can have up to 3 rows and should be seperated with an empty line.

???+ bug
    Having more than 24 character in a row will cause the text to flow outside of the display-box.

# File "rules.txt"

This file is used to store all "rules" displayed when using the "Rules" card.

Rule-entries can have up to 3 rows and should be seperated with an empty line.

???+ bug
    Having more than 24 character in a row will cause the text to flow outside of the display-box.

**Resource-Folder**{: .xmlInfo .green}: Placing this file in your mods "resource" folder will replace the original file.

**Content-Folder**{: .xmlInfo .red}: Placing this file in your mods "content" folder has no effect!

# Class "RoomDescriptor"

???+ info
    You can get this class by using the following functions:

    * [Level:GetCurrentRoomDesc()](Level.md#getcurrentroomdesc)
    * [Level:GetLastRoomDesc()](Level.md#getlastroomdesc)
    * [Level:GetRoomByIdx()](Level.md#getroombyidx)

    ???+ example "Example Code"
        ```lua
        local level = Game():GetLevel()
        local roomDescriptor = level:GetCurrentRoomDesc()
        ```

## Variables
### Allowed·Doors {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### DoorSet AllowedDoors  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

???+ bug "Bug"
    This variable contains userdata and is therefore not useable.

___
### Display·Flags {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int DisplayFlags  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

Indicates what is visible on the minimap.
**Display Flags (bitwise):**
```lua
1 << -1 -- Invisible
1 << 0 -- Visible
1 << 1 -- Room Shadow
1 << 2 -- Show Icon
```

???- example "Examples"
    The flags are hard to interpret, but here are some examples:

    **000** = invisible, this is how most rooms start

    **101** = standard room visibility, this includes rooms that are adjacent and you haven't actively visited. This will usually show icons.

    **011** = secret room, locked rooms, sac rooms pre-entry*

    **111** = 011 rooms after entry, but also the rooms directly adjacent to them* (applied after entry)

    \* If you have Spelunker Hat, bit 1 is completely unused. All special rooms will have the normal behavior of either 000 or 101. This is unique to Spelunker Hat; mapping items follow the normal rules.

???+ quote "Quote from User 'Budj'"
    From this my best guess is that bits 1 and 2 are special rendering (display) flags that may have more meaning down below.

    The important bit for using them is minding that they're used differently mostly for special rooms.

    As far as I've seen, 001 is completely unused.
    010, 100, and 110 may be used for compass or blue map, I don't remember. I think they use 100.

### Flags {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int Flags  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }
The RoomDescriptor flags for the room.
___
### Grid·Index {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int GridIndex  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

- For a 1x1 room, this is equal to the 1x1 grid index of the room.
- For a room bigger than a 1x1 room, this is equal to the top left 1x1 quadrant.
- For `RoomType.ROOMSHAPE_LTL` rooms (i.e. rooms that look like a "J"), this is equal to the 1x1 quadrant where the gap in the room is. In other words, it is a 1x1 quadrant that is not actually contained within the room.
- Note that **this value is different** than the value returned by `Level:GetCurrentRoomIndex()`. (That function returns the 1x1 quadrant that the room was entered in.)
- Data structures that store data per room should use `ListIndex` as a key instead of `GridIndex`, since the former is unique across different dimensions.

### Has·Water {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### boolean HasWater  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

___
### List·Index {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int ListIndex  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

The index for this room corresponding to the `Level.GetRooms().Get()` method. In other words, this is equal to the order that the room was created by the floor generation algorithm.

Use this as an index for data structures that store data per room, since it is unique across different dimensions.

___
### No·Reward {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### boolean NoReward  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

___
### Override·Data {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### [RoomConfigRoom](RoomConfig_Room.md) OverrideData  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }
The room variant is in Data. Because Room::Init uses a mix of data, one from level layout and one from replacement data like minibosses, we need to hold the new room data somewhere.
___
### Pits·Count {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int PitsCount  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

___
### Poop·Count {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int PoopCount  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

___
### Pressure·Plates·Triggered {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### boolean PressurePlatesTriggered  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

___
### Sacrifice·Done {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### boolean SacrificeDone  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

___
### Safe·Grid·Index {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int SafeGridIndex  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }

- For a 1x1 room, this is equal to the 1x1 grid index of the room.
- For a room bigger than a 1x1 room, this is equal to the top left 1x1 quadrant.
- For `RoomType.ROOMSHAPE_LTL` rooms (i.e. rooms that look like a "J"), this is equal to the top right 1x1 quadrant.
- Note that **this value is different** than the value returned by `Level:GetCurrentRoomIndex()`. (That function returns the 1x1 quadrant that the room was entered in.)
- Data structures that store data per room should use `ListIndex` as a key instead of `SafeGridIndex`, since the former is unique across different dimensions.

### Shop·Item·Discount·Idx {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int ShopItemDiscountIdx  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }
- The index that denotes which shop item(s) will be discounted.
- Can be a value from -1 to 7.
- All items in the room with this ShopItemId will be affected by the discount.
    - This is noticeable when there are more than 8 shop items in a room.
- A value of -1 means there is no discounted item.
- This value is unaffected by Steam Sale.
- Defaults to -1 in non-shop rooms.
- Can be modified by accessing the writable version of the RoomDescriptor like this:

```lua
local level = Game():GetLevel()
local room = level:GetCurrentRoom()

-- this returns a writable RoomDescriptor for the current Room.
local writableRoomDesc = level:GetRoomByIdx(level:GetCurrentRoomIndex())

-- Sets the current Room's ShopItemDiscountIdx to 0.
-- All items with ShopItemId 0 will be discounted.
writableRoomDesc.ShopItemDiscountIdx = 0

-- update the Room using Update() to have the change take effect.
room:Update()
```

___
### Shop·Item·Idx {: aria-label='Variables' }
[ ](#){: .abrep .tooltip .badge }
#### int ShopItemIdx  {: .copyable aria-label='Variables' }
- The ShopItemId value of the next shop item to add to the room.
    - If this is set to 1 in a Room and another shop item is created, the new item will have a ShopItemId of 1, and the Room's ShopItemIdx will then be 2.
- Can be used as the total number of items in the shop, up to 7 items.
- Can be a value between 0 and 7.
- For every 8 items in a shop, this value resets itself to 0.
    - For example, if a custom shop has 9 items, the 1st and 9th items will share the same ShopItemId of 0, and the RoomDescriptor ShopItemIdx value will be 1.
- Defaults to -1 in non-shop rooms.
- Can be modified by accessing the writable version of the RoomDescriptor like this:

```lua
local level = Game():GetLevel()
local room = level:GetCurrentRoom()

-- this returns a writable RoomDescriptor for the current Room.
local writableRoomDesc = level:GetRoomByIdx(level:GetCurrentRoomIndex())

-- Sets the current Room's ShopItemIdx to 0.
writableRoomDesc.ShopItemIdx = 0

-- update the Room using Update() to have the change take effect.
room:Update()
```

???- note "Notes"
    - In the image below, each item's ShopItemId is written underneath it.
    - Notice how all items that share a ShopItemId have the same PickupVariant, but aren't identical.
    - ShopItemDiscountIdx is 2, so all shop items with a ShopItemId of 2 are on sale.
    - After all items are created, the ShopItemIdx for this room is 0.
